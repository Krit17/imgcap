This python script is used to extract image features from Caffe ConvNets. Code is adapted from https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk.
The two prototxt files are the Caffe network definitions for VGG16 and VGG19, they are the same as the ones found in Caffe model zoo minus the softmax layer at the end.
